## Inspiring Tales
Deng Yaping was short in stature and was not initially favored for table - tennis. However, with her extraordinary perseverance and determination, she carried out high - intensity training. She swung her racket tens of thousands of times in the gym every day. To increase her leg strength, she tied sandbags to her calves for practice. On the court, her eyes were sharp and her fighting spirit was high. With her excellent skills and tenacious fighting spirit, she won a total of 18 world championships, and won both the women's singles and women's doubles championships at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
## Spirit embodied
The courage to break through congenital limitations, tenacious struggle, and never giving up.
