## Inspiring Tales
Bolt was born into an ordinary family in Jamaica. He showed a keen interest in running when he was a child. In the early days of his training, he was tall and lanky and not favored. He was even criticized by his coach for his running - style problems. However, he didn't give up. He continuously improved his techniques and trained hard. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, he broke the world record and won the 100 - meter final with a time of 9.69 seconds, and then broke the world record in the 200 - meter event. In the subsequent London Olympics and Rio Olympics, he continued to dominate the sprinting field.
