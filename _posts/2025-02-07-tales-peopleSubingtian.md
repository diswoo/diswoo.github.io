## Inspiring Tales
Su Bingtian is not outstanding in height among sprinters, but with scientific training methods and unremitting efforts, he has continuously broken through his own limits. He pays attention to technical details and carefully polishes the starting, mid - race running, and sprinting links. In the men's 100 - meter semi - final of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, he refreshed the Asian record with a time of 9.83 seconds and became the first Asian to reach the men's 100 - meter final of the Olympics.
